## Hi there 👋 I'm Asim


I'm a backend developer with 1.5+ years of hands-on experience using the **MERN stack** to build, maintain, and scale real-world applications.


🧩 I specialize in:
- Building and consuming **RESTful APIs**
- Developing secure, well-structured **Node.js** backend logic
- Debugging issues across the stack and optimizing performance
- Implementing features and bug fixes
- Writing clean, maintainable, and scalable code
- Solving real-world issues through debugging and refactoring


💡 What I’ve been doing recently:
- backend development for projects built with **React + Node**
- Creating reusable controller logic and middleware in **Express**
- Integrating external APIs, handling authentication, and optimizing data flows
- Writing scalable route handlers and improving efficiency


🛠️ Tech I work with daily:
`JavaScript` `Node.js` `Express` `MongoDB` `React`  
`Mongoose` `Postman` `Git` `VS Code`
`Docker (learning)` `AWS (learning)`


🌱 Currently learning:
- **DevOps basics** – Docker, CI/CD pipelines, monitoring & Deployment
- **System Design** - fundamentals and architecture best practices
- **Cloud Services** -  Cloud fundamentals & AWS basics


📌 Featured Projects: (coming soon)


🎯 Goals this year:
- Build a portfolio with real, deployable MERN apps
- Contribute to open source and collaborate with developers
- Become confident in deployment and DevOps workflows


👯 I’m looking to collaborate on:
- **Deployment & CI/CD**
- **System Design & API architecture**
- **Cloud fundamentals & DevSecOps**
